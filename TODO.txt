- (extra) string should be able to identify excape char e.g. \n \' \t
- (extra) auto generate output file than can do checking if file exist, if yes then imcrement a number so that it do not replace the existed output file
- write report


material for report
maybe can try compare execution time
flex is more easy to write

- flex
easy to write (implement) cause have a documentation
can declare condition

- python
build from scratch
more sensitive to position
e.g
>=|<=|==|=|>|<
=|>|<|>=|<=|==
this 2 will yield 2 different result
this wont happend in flex, flex is more smart
